# This package contains the different extraction strategies that the pipeline can use.
#
# Each strategy is a self-contained module that implements a specific approach
# for extracting data from a document page. This modular, pluggable architecture
# makes it easy to add new strategies or modify existing ones without affecting
# the rest of the pipeline.
