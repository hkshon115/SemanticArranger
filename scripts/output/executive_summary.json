  "executive_summary": "This document presents a quarterly financial performance overview for the year 2024, tracking two primary metrics: Revenue and Profit across all four quarters. The data reveals a strong positive trajectory throughout the year, with Revenue demonstrating a 100% growth rate from Q1 to Q4 (increasing from 300 to 600 units), representing consistent quarter-over-quarter expansion. This growth pattern indicates successful business operations and market penetration during the fiscal year.\n\nThe Profit metric similarly shows healthy growth, increasing 60% from 100 units in Q1 to 160 units in Q4. While profit growth is positive, it trails revenue growth proportionally, suggesting either increased operational costs, strategic investments, or changing margin dynamics as the business scales. The consistent upward trend in both metrics across all four quarters indicates sustained business momentum without significant setbacks or seasonal volatility during 2024.",
